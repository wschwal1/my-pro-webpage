# Professional Website

## Purpose/Goals

The purpose of this repo is to eventually create a professional website with the goal to present myself as a professional historian as well as to publish my research project.

## Model Websites

First, It is surprising how few scholars in my field maintain their own websites. Historians of China are apparently not particularly keen on presenting themselves and their research to a broader public.

**Hilary Izatt (<https://www.hilaryizatt.com/home>)**

Pros:

1. The sections of the website (projects, dissertation, teaching, cv) seem to be useful for marketing/publishing purposes.
2. The brief introduction of Dr. Izatt's research interests on the home page appears to be an important feature.

Cons:

1. The design seems a little off (the header is too big, font sizes are off, etc.). Generally speaking, the website feels "not in harmony."

**Albert Monshan Wu (<http://www.albert-wu.com/>)**

Pros:

1. The tabs seem to be useful, although I like Dr. Izatt's selection/naming better.

2. The small line under his name briefly describing who he is seems useful for indentification purposes.

## Design Ideas

Since I already started a website for this course, I would like to use that as a foundation. For example, the block with my information/education can be moved into a "About me" page. This would declutter the home page. What is currently called "about me" can remain as a brief introductory text on the home page.
